# Funnel-Analysis-
Funnel analysis is a method of data analysis used to track and understand the sequential steps or stages that users or customers go through when interacting with a product, service, or website.

# SUMMARY

The project focused on understanding and improving the user funnel, encompassing key stages from app download to ride review. Our goal was to identify areas for enhancement and optimization. The customer funnel comprises seven stages, starting from app download to review. Drop-offs occur at various stages, necessitating funnel analysis for improvement. Business questions revolve around key aspects like drop-off points, platform performance, age group preferences, surge pricing, and low conversion areas.
